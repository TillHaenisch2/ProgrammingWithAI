# ProgrammingWithAI
Samples and some doc for my introductory class about programming with github copilot andf other AI tools.

We will begin the class by introducing key concepts about AI and LLMs to get a basic understanding and some intuition 
about what will work and what not. Then we will do some prompting for fun and profit including a little promt battle to get us started.

In the main part we will introduce github copilot (using Visual Studio Code) as an autocompletion on steroids. 
Using it this way, the entry barrier for students with no or only some prior knowledge is lowered considerably and allows us to go to
the fun part of coding much faster and skip a big pile of frustration about syntax.

In the second part we will switch gears and go up one abstraction level: we will focus on creating functions that do the detail work
and allow us to think about the parts which make up our program (read: the solution to a problem).

We will use some data-handling code as an example, like reading a CSV-file from python, extracting the relevant data, do some stuff with it,
draw a nice chart etc. As a second topic here we will introduce (read: find out on ourselves) that debugging is an important part when
generating code and how to do that using AI.

This will lead us to use genAI to generate tests for our code and introduce the TDD concept.
